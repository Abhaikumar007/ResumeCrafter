    You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to parse the following raw text from a user's CV notes and convert it into a structured JSON object.

    The JSON object must have the following schema. For 'experience' and 'projects', capture all the descriptive text as a SINGLE STRING in the 'raw_notes' field.
    - "contact_info": {{ "name": "...", "phone": "...", "email": "...", "linkedin": "(username only)", "github": "(username only)" }}
    - "summary": "A short, raw summary string from the user. Do not make a new one."
    - "education": [ {{ "degree": "...", "university": "...", "dates": "...", "location": "..." }} ]
    - "certifications": [ {{ "name": "...", "date": "...", "issuer": "..." }} ]
    - "experience": [ {{ "title": "...", "company": "...", "dates": "...", "location": "...", "raw_notes": "A single string containing all user notes for this job." }} ]
    - "projects": [ {{ "name": "...", "raw_notes": "A single string of user notes.", "technologies": ["..."], "url": "..." }} ]
    - "skills": {{
        "Languages": ["..."],
        "Frameworks/Technologies": ["..."],
        "Databases": ["..."],
        "Tools": ["..."]
      }}

    If a section or field is not present in the text, omit it.

    Raw Text to Parse:
    ---
    {raw_text}
    ---

    Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any other text, markdown formatting like ```json, or explanations.
